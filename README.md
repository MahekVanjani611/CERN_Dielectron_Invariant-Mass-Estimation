# CERN Dielectron Invariant Mass Estimation
## Contributors : Shikhar Dave and Mahek Vanjani
### The CERN Dielectron Invariant Mass Estimation project focuses on predicting the invariant mass of electron-positron pairs produced in collisions at the CERN electron lab. The goal is to leverage various physical properties measured during these collisions to estimate the invariant mass accurately. The challenge lies in finding an optimal tradeoff between sensor data acquisition costs and model accuracy.
## About Dataset
This dataset contains 100k dielectron events in the invariant mass range 2-110 GeV for use in outreach and education. These data were selected for use in education and outreach and contain a subset of the total event information.
## Content
* Run: The run number of the event
* Event: The event number.
* E1, E2: The total energy of the electron (GeV) for electrons 1 and 2.
* px1,py1,pz1,px2,py2,pz2: The components of the momemtum of the electron 1 and 2 (GeV).
* pt1, pt2: The transverse momentum of the electron 1 and 2 (GeV).
* eta1, eta2: The pseudorapidity of the electron 1 and 2.
* phi1, phi2: The phi angle of the electron 1 and 2 (rad).
* Q1, Q2: The charge of the electron 1 and 2.
* M: The invariant mass of two electrons (GeV).
