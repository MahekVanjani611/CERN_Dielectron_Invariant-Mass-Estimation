# CERN Dielectron Invariant Mass Estimation
# Contributors : Shikhar Dave and Mahek Vanjani
## The CERN Dielectron Invariant Mass Estimation project focuses on predicting the invariant mass of electron-positron pairs produced in collisions at the CERN electron lab. The goal is to leverage various physical properties measured during these collisions to estimate the invariant mass accurately. The challenge lies in finding an optimal tradeoff between sensor data acquisition costs and model accuracy.
